        <p>I'm Christina Chen, and I'm thrilled to share a bit about myself and my journey with you. I've always been an adventurous spirit, whether it's hiking in the great outdoors, playing tennis, or indulging in my love for interstellar-type movies and being a super fan of The Big Bang Theory.</p>

        <h2>Special Things About Me</h2>
        <p>One thing that sets me apart is my unconventional career path. I spent over a decade working as a nurse, caring for others and making a difference in their lives. However, I couldn't shake the feeling that tech was my true calling. So, I made the bold decision to pivot my career and dive headfirst into the world of technology.</p>
        <p>This transition wasn't easy, but it was incredibly rewarding. It's taught me the value of perseverance, adaptability, and never being afraid to pursue my passions.</p>
